        <p>
            House Cast members play fully scripted, highly comic roles in continually running productions.
            As a cast member, you would be expected to memorize at least one full-length play, to prepare
            with limited rehearsal, and to be available to perform weekly at least two weekday evenings & at
            least two weekends every month. (You may work at other jobs/theatres as well as long as you are
            consistently available to us.) Cast members average 5-10 performances per month, and are paid
            well per performance with opportunity for raises.
        </p>

        <h2 class="customH3">IMPORTANT NOTE ON YOUR AVAILABILITY:</h2>
        <p>
            <u>Please only audition if your schedule is generally open so that you are available to us
                twice a week AS WELL AS two weekends a month.</u>
            (Again, you may work other jobs/theatres as long as you are consistently available to us as well.)
